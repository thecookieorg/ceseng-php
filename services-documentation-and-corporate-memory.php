						C.E.S. Group considers easily accessible, adequate and meaningful documentation of an organization’s assets and related activity provides added value.
					</p>

					<p>
						The added value is due to the time saved by having quick access to pertinent information, evidence-based information leading to good decisions by avoiding biased conclusions, and preservation of corporate memory.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The preservation of corporate memory is a significant added value. With a highly mobile workforce coupled with the possibility of retiring employees, significant quantities of information on an organization’s assets can be lost.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The selection of the DIMO Maint solution conserves this information and allows for the development of a consolidated, codified and easily retrievable corporate memory based on assets or the players working in asset management.
