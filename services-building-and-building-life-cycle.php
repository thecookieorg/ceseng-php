						<h1>BUILDING AND BUILDING SYSTEM LIFE CYCLES</h1>

						C.E.S. illustrates the life cycle of a building in four phases. The time scale divisions of these stages are approximate and indicative only; they depend on the building and its specific components and the resulting maintenance and management required. These phases are described as follows: 
						<ul>
							<li>0 to 15 years: maintenance and replacement projects on some support equipment reaching the end of their useful lives, such as domestic water pumps, sewage pumps, water heaters, carpets, etc.</li>
							<li>16 to 30 years: maintenance and replacement or restoration projects of certain equipment (elevators, boilers, etc.) and systems (roofs, etc.) that reach the ends of their useful lives. Certain equipment or systems also become technologically obsolete.</li>
							<li>31 years to 50 years: maintenance and replacement or restoration projects of certain equipment and systems with longer life cycles (walls, fenestration, alarm systems, paving, interior design, etc.) as well as maintenance, replacement or restoration of certain equipment that was already replaced during the previous phases. Certain equipment or systems also become technologically obsolete.</li>
							<li>50 years plus: The building continues to function. The building manager will face maintenance, replacement or restoration decisions for equipment and systems that were previously addressed in addition to dealing with problems related to an aging building.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This life-cycle approach is applicable to any system within the building. However, the time scale and content of each phase will differ depending on the particular item being evaluated.
